# monopoly

pending full documentation

Currently the program simulates different strategies which buy up all the properties, purchase houses on the properties, and continue until only one player remains and is determined the winner.

The game does not currently simulate jail, chance/community cards, or trading.

Future areas to explore could be how house rules affect the game, such as free parking collects taxes or landing on GO doubles the money you recieve.
